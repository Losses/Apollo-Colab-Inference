*Original work [Apollo: Band-sequence Modeling for High-Quality Music Restoration in Compressed Audio](https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo)*  

Apollo audio restoration Colab fork  
The model was trained to restore/enhance lossy mp3 audio with bitrate <= 128 kbps.


**v0.3**
- lew's separated vocals enhancer model added

**v0.2**
- added overlap feature
- new inference.py created for easier local CLI use

**v0.1**
- added chunking for long audio inputs
- ~~added "dual mono" processing for stereo audio input (processing each channel independently)~~
